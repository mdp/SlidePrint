# Privacy Policy for SlidePrint Chrome Extension

**Effective Date:** 2025.09.19
**Last Updated:** 2025.09.19

## Overview

SlidePrint is a Chrome extension that allows users to capture and print slides from presentations, DocSend decks, and other web-based documents. This privacy policy explains how we handle information when you use our extension.

## Information We Do NOT Collect

**We do not collect, store, transmit, or analyze any of your data.** Specifically:

- **No Personal Information:** We do not collect names, email addresses, or any other personal identifiers
- **No Browsing Data:** We do not track your browsing history, websites visited, or online activities
- **No User Content:** We do not store or transmit any content you capture, including screenshots, documents, or slide images

## How the Extension Works

SlidePrint operates entirely locally on your device:

1. **Screen Capture:** The extension captures selected areas of web pages you choose to screenshot
2. **Local Processing:** All image processing and compilation happens locally in your browser
3. **Local Storage Only:** Captured images are temporarily stored only in your browser's local memory during the capture session
4. **No External Transmission:** No data is sent to external servers, third parties, or our systems

## Permissions Explained

SlidePrint requires certain Chrome permissions to function:

- **Host Permissions (All Sites):** Required to inject the capture functionality into web pages and enable one-click selection and capture on any website you visit
- **Storage Permission:** Used only for temporary local storage of captured images during your session
- **Active Tab Permission:** Allows the extension to interact with the currently active tab for capturing content

**Important:** These permissions enable local functionality only. We do not use these permissions to collect or transmit any data.

## Data Retention

Since we don't collect any data, there is no data retention. Any images captured during your session are:

- Stored temporarily in your browser's local memory only
- Automatically cleared when you close the output tab or restart your browser
- Never transmitted outside your device

## Third-Party Services

SlidePrint does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics platforms, or external APIs. The extension functions entirely offline and locally.

## Children's Privacy

Since we do not collect any personal information, our extension does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted with an updated "Last Updated" date. Since we don't collect contact information, we cannot notify users directly of changes.
